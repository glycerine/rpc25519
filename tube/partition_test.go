	// can we test this without putting assert/panics
	// into the prod code... keep the history of
	// timer resets + notes about role, and where in
	// code, in a history. assert over that history.
	// a history is like a channel but inf growth
	// and can view as well as add to it; but should
	// not be deleted from? or could be like ring
	// buffer. If a chan indicates readiness to
	// provide a value, then well it can change its
	// mind and upon running a func backed channel,
	// it can return a pointer to a ticket with error...
	// how are channels implemented? in go, to model
	// our histories after them... its just a time series!
	// hint cn/dfs!?! the safety/liveness assertions
	// should be signal FSM on top of a set of
	// output time series. the tree os signals
	// can compute up to the top, and output
	// a correct or invariant violation guarantee
	// at each timestep! If at any step we
	// see violation, we have the full history
